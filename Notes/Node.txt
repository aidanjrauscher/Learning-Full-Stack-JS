Intro to Node:
- Node.js is a JS runtime environment, running the V8 JS engine. 
- Runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. 
- ASYNCHRONOUS -> execution continues on another block while waiting for response
- Callback: a function passed as an argument to another function
- No DOM (document, window) like in browser
- 'nodemon app.js' instead of 'node app.js' for automatic restarts when file changes
